# Zeon UI Theme

This is an __elegant theme__ who loves gradients with stylish look.

This theme includes font changes and icon changes at __minimum__ However I am always happy to tweak my settings according to community's opinions. So if you have any suggestions, just shot it!.
Would be glad to know if I inspire anyone. Therefore, you can contact to me as well.

Happy coding! ðŸš€


## Installing

1. Settings -> Install -> Search -> Zeon UI.
2. Now go and select Zeon.

If you get stuck somewhere, feel free to create an issue.

# Notes
I'm using Atom Material Dark for __Syntax__. However, I'm planning to make a syntax theme as well!
